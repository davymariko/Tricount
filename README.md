# Tricount
Python program to help friends with their expenses to set accounts to zero.

It is therefore a question here of producing a list of transactions allowing each person to be reimbursed from a list of expenses.
The description of an expense includes several elements:
- The name of the person who paid the expense (here denoted by a number);
- The amount (strictly positive);
- The names of the persons concerned (denoted by a number too);
